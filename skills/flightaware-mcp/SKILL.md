name: flightaware-mcp
description: Live flight tracking and aviation data via FlightAware AeroAPI through MCP. Use when the user asks to track a flight, look up a flight's status/position/route/track, see an airport's arrivals/departures/delays/weather, find flights for an airline, look up an aircraft's owner, get scheduled flights between dates, or manage FlightAware flight alerts. Triggers on phrases like "where is flight UAL123", "track flight", "JFK departures", "is my flight delayed", "flights near", "who owns tail number N12345", or "set up a flight alert". Requires the @chrischall/flightaware-mcp package installed and the flightaware server registered (see Setup), plus an AeroAPI key.

# flightaware-mcp

MCP server for **FlightAware AeroAPI** (v4) — live flight tracking, airport boards, operators, schedules, aircraft, and flight alerts, exposed to Claude over stdio.

- **npm:** [npmjs.com/package/@chrischall/flightaware-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chrischall/flightaware-mcp)
- **Source:** [github.com/chrischall/flightaware-mcp](https://github.com/chrischall/flightaware-mcp)

## Setup

### Option A — npx (recommended)

Add to `.mcp.json` in your project or `~/.claude/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flightaware": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@chrischall/flightaware-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "AEROAPI_API_KEY": "your-aeroapi-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Get a key at [flightaware.com/aeroapi/portal](https://www.flightaware.com/aeroapi/portal/). The free **Personal** tier (500 calls/month) is enough to get started; AeroAPI bills per query.

### Option B — from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrischall/flightaware-mcp
cd flightaware-mcp
npm install && npm run build
```

## Environment

| Var | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AEROAPI_API_KEY` | yes | Your FlightAware AeroAPI key (sent as the `x-apikey` header). |
| `AEROAPI_OUTPUT_DIR` | no | Default directory for flight-map PNGs (default: cwd). |
| `AEROAPI_CACHE_TTL` | no | Seconds to cache identical **live-data** GET responses to cut per-query billing (default: 15; `0` disables). |
| `AEROAPI_STATIC_CACHE_TTL` | no | Longer TTL for **reference data** that rarely changes — airport/operator info, routes, ownership, canonical lookups (default: 3600; `0` disables). |

## Tools

Every read tool below takes an optional `view` and answers on the **compact**
rung when you omit it — see [Response shape](#response-shape-view).

**Flights:** `fa_get_flights`, `fa_search_flights`, `fa_search_flights_advanced`, `fa_search_flight_positions`, `fa_count_flights`, `fa_get_flight_track`, `fa_get_flight_position`, `fa_get_flight_route`, `fa_get_flight_map`, `fa_get_flight_history`, `fa_resolve_flight`

**Airports:** `fa_get_airport`, `fa_get_airport_flights`, `fa_get_airport_flight_counts`, `fa_get_airport_routes`, `fa_list_airports`, `fa_get_nearby_airports`, `fa_get_airport_delays`, `fa_get_airport_weather`, `fa_resolve_airport`

**Operators / aircraft:** `fa_get_operator`, `fa_get_operator_flights`, `fa_list_operators`, `fa_get_aircraft_owner`

**Schedules / predictive:** `fa_get_scheduled_flights`, `fa_foresight_search` (Foresight is a premium tier — expect a 402/403 on a Personal key)

**Alerts** (account-mutating writes are confirm-gated — without `confirm: true` they return a dry-run preview and make no network call): `fa_list_alerts`, `fa_get_alert`, `fa_create_alert`, `fa_update_alert`, `fa_delete_alert`, `fa_get_alerts_endpoint`, `fa_set_alerts_endpoint`

## Response shape (`view`)

Twenty-eight of the thirty-four tools take `view: "compact" | "full"`, and
**`compact` is the default** — every read answers on the slim rung without
being asked. In practice that is *every read tool here except*
`fa_get_flight_map` and `fa_healthcheck`; the four alert writes
(`fa_create_alert`, `fa_update_alert`, `fa_delete_alert`,
`fa_set_alerts_endpoint`) take none either.

**Compact here is media stripping, not a field projection — do not expect a
field list.** It removes image and avatar URLs from the payload and nothing
else. These tools hand back AeroAPI's response close to verbatim, and this repo
holds no captured AeroAPI fixture and no documented field list, so nothing in
it can honestly say which of FlightAware's fields matter and which are noise.
Inventing a keep-list would risk a flight record coming back with holes in it
that reads like a verified answer. Stripping is subtractive: it cannot lose a
field nobody knew about. The practical consequence is that on a typical AeroAPI
flight or airport payload compact saves little — it is the honest ceiling, not
a compression claim.

`view: "full"` returns AeroAPI's payload untouched. There is deliberately **no
`raw` rung**: nothing normalises the payload on the way through, so `full`
already IS the untouched upstream response and a third value would silently
alias it.

Why the six without it have none:

- **`fa_get_flight_map`'s product IS the image.** It returns a rendered PNG —
  written to disk, or inline base64 with `inline: true`. Routing that through a
  rung whose whole job is removing images would delete exactly what you asked
  for, so it is not wired and never should be.
- **`fa_healthcheck`** answers "is this connector working?" with a verdict, not
  a record. There is nothing in it to strip.
- **The four alert writes return receipts** — an id, a status, a dry-run
  preview. A receipt has nothing to strip and everything to keep.
  `fa_get_alerts_endpoint` is the read of that pair and does take `view`.

Passing `view` to one of those six is not an error and not a warning: MCP tool
schemas are non-strict, so the key is dropped and you get that tool's ordinary
output.

## Notes

- Flight idents can be a designator (`UAL123`), a registration (`N12345`), or an `fa_flight_id`; position/track/route/map tools take an `fa_flight_id`.
- Paged collections return a `links.next` cursor — pass it back as `cursor` to fetch more.
- Every request rides your own AeroAPI key; usage counts against your subscription quota.
